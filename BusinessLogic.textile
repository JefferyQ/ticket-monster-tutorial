* Implementing basic CRUD operation 
* Encapsulating business logic in services and integrating with the persistence tier
* Using CDI for integrating individual services
* Functional testing using arquillian
* Implementing cross-cutting concerns such as logging
* Exposing RESTful services via JAX-RS
