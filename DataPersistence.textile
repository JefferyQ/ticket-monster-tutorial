You have set up your project successfully. Now it is time to begin working on the TicketMonster application, and the first step is adding its persistence layer. After reading this guide, you'll understand how we did this, and grasp why we made certain design choices. Topics covered include:

* RDBMS design using JPA entity beans
* Basic unit testing using JUnit
* How to populate some test data
* How to validate your entities using Bean Validation
* Basic modification (CRUD) to entities

And of course the guide will take you through the boring business of configuration.

The tutorial will show you how to perform all these steps in JBoss Developer Studio, including screenshots that guide you through . For those of you who prefer to watch and learn, the included video shows you how we performed all the steps.
