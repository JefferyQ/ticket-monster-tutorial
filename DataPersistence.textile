h1. Building The Persistence Layer

h2. Learn how we built the persistence layer for the application, and how we added tests for it

---

This guide shows you how we built the persistence layer for the TicketMonster application. After reading this guide, you'll understand how we built the persistence layer, and grasp why we made certain design choices. Topics covered include:

* RDBMS design using JPA entity beans
* Basic unit testing using JUnit
* How to populate some test data
* How to validate your entities using Bean Validation
* Basic modification (CRUD) to entities

And of course the tutorial will take you through the boring business of configuration.
